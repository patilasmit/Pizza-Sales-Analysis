Project Title: Pizza Sales Analysis
Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain.
The dataset includes information such as orders, customers, pizzas sold, prices, and dates.

Objectives:
Data Exploration: Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.

Analysis Tasks:
Calculate total revenue over a specified period.
Identify the most popular pizzas (best-sellers).
Analyze sales trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
Segment customers based on their ordering behavior (frequency, total spending).
Investigate any correlations between pizza toppings and sales.

SQL Skills Demonstrated:
Data querying using SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN, etc.
Aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG).
Subqueries and nested queries.
Date functions for time-based analysis.
Data cleaning techniques.

Tools Used:
SQL: MySQL (relational database management system).
IDE: ( MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)

Dataset:
Source: Simulated dataset generated for educational purposes.
Structure: Multiple tables (e.g., Orders,order_details,pizzas,pizza_type).

Key Queries:
Query 1: Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
Query 2: Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza ordered.
Query 3: List customers with the highest total spending.
Query 4: Determine daily sales trends for the last 30 days.
Query 5: Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.

Conclusion:
This SQL portfolio project on pizza sales demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and querying skills using SQL.
It showcases the ability to derive meaningful insights from a relational database and present them in a structured manner.
